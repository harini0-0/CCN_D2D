# CCN_D2D

Algorithm Part 1 (for 20 Marks):
1. The available Device to Device (D2D) pairs should be sharded (cluster) based on the
application, Public Safety and Commercial Applications. For Sharding, any clustering
algorithm can be considered.
2. A shard may contain any number of D2D Pairs.
3. Each shard should have at least one Cellular User (CU).
4. Display the shard members.

Algorithm Part 2 (for 20 Marks):
Based on the shardes created in Part 1, carry out the communication considering the following
points.
1. Assume there are N D2D pairs (D2DN) in a shard where N ranges from 1 ,...., N.
(assume public safety shard for the experiment). The D2D pairs start communication in
regular intervals i.e, the D2D1 pair starts data transfer at 2 second, the D2D2 pair starts
data transfer at 3 second, the D2D3 pair starts data transfer at 4 seconds etc.
2. Assume the default attribute values for both D2D and CU in the experiment.
3. Calculate the SINR of each D2D pair according to the following table.
